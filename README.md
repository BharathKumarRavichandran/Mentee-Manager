# Mentee Manager

## About
A webpage where we can manage all our mentees, give them ratings, and write comments about their progress.

## Features
* Each mentee will have their own box dedicated for them where the mentor can add a rating and add comments in a text field.
* Mentors can edit and delete mentee profiles.
* Based on the ratings provided by the mentor, the background color of the box varies from red to green.
* A sort button to sort mentees based on their rating.
* Implemented saving to local storage, so that the information remains even when the page is refreshed.
* Mentee boxes will be in a compact form at first, displaying only the name and rating. When clicked, the mentee box will expand revealing all details. When another mentee box is clicked the first one collapses and the new one expands.
* Responsive to screen size (mobile-compatible)
